# Advanced ActiveRecord Querying / Querying Has_many Associations

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Advanced ActiveRecord Querying](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/advanced-activerecord-querying) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

In this exercise, you'll continue to query the same database schema from before, but using more complex concepts like subqueries.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/querying-has_many-associations.git
    cd querying-has_many-associations
    bin/setup

After cloning and running `bin/setup`, you'll see a list of pending tests. Follow the instructions in the pending test messages and implement methods on the `Person` model to get all the tests passing.

You can run `rake` to re-run the tests at any time.

After cloning and running `bin/setup`:

* Review `db/schema.rb` to get a sense of the database schema you'll be querying.
* Take a look at the classes in `app/models` to get familiar with the models and associations you'll be working with.
* Edit `spec/models/person_spec.rb` and remove the `pending` line from the first spec.
* Edit `app/models/person.rb` and implement `order_by_location_name` to get the spec passing.
* Repeat this process for the remaining pending specs in `person_spec.rb`.

You can run `rake` to re-run the tests at any time.

Once all the tests are passing (and there are no pending specs), you're all set!

## Tips and Tricks

Watch the [trail video](https://upcase.com/videos/advanced-querying-has-many) on querying `has_many` associations and check out the documentation for [`joins`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods.html#method-i-joins), [`distinct`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods.html#method-i-distinct), and [`from`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods.html#method-i-from).

## Tips
* prefer sequel string over includes/references because
** it's depending on an implementation detail that could change
** it's less declarative
** the query is less readable because it has to alias all columns in order to avoid potential ambiguity
** can be less performant if you don't need all the records loaded (because it eager loads)
